# LSC-project

Large scale computing project

# Goal
The goal of the LSC prac1cal project is to prepare the material for a possible lab ac1vity for
other LM (Master) students on a topic related to the prac1cal part of the LSC course:

• APIs of the Spark ecosystems: advanced aspects of RDDs/DataFrames&SparkSQL/Spark
Streaming, and other components, i.e., GraphX&GraphFrames and MLib

• Op1miza1ons such as custom par11oners, parameter tuning, performance monitoring,
etc

• Integra1on with data inges1on systems such as KaSa, other visual tools such as Nifi,
cloud-based services such as Dataproc and Dataflow, etc

The proposed exercises should be complementary to those presented in the examples of
the course so as to enrich the material for the next edi1ons of the course (i.e., also a
proac1ve way to provide your feedback to the course by sugges1ng what you would have
liked to see and we did not discuss).

Assignment
Each group (max 3 students) is required to submit

• a short document (max 5 pages, notebook or PDF) organized in 4 parts:

P1: a presenta1on of the chosen topic

P2: a report describing 8-10 programming ques1ons related to the topic

P3: a short descrip1on of the “educa1onal goals” behind the choice of the selected
topic and ques1ons

P4: solu1ons and 1mings of the proposed exercises both on local and cluster mode
when it is possible to perform this kind of comparison
